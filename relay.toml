# The relay can also be used to dual write data to Kapacitor
#
# There are a few advantages of using the relay instead of relying on InfluxDB subscriptions
#
# 1. Traffic is HTTP/TCP meaning you don't have to worry about dropped UDP packets
# 2. Less load on InfluxDB since it doesn't have to fork the data.
# 3. Slighly lower latency since there is one less hop.


# This example config sends all writes to two InfluxDB hosts.
